# Express API Tour Project

This project is a comprehensive tour application built using modern back-end technologies, including **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. Developed as part of an online course by Maximilian, this project serves as a real-world example of creating a fully functional RESTful API and a server-side rendered website.

## Features

- **Modern Back-End Stack**: Understand the back-end stack with Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose to build robust applications.
  
- **Complete Application Development**: Create a beautiful and feature-rich application from scratch, covering both the API and server-side rendering.
  
- **RESTful API**: Implement a fast, scalable API that includes essential features like filters, sorting, pagination, and more.

- **Node.js Insights**: Learn how Node.js operates behind the scenes, including the event loop, blocking vs non-blocking code, and module management.

- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Perform CRUD operations with MongoDB using Mongoose, diving into advanced features and handling geospatial data.

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Integrate advanced authentication techniques, including password resets, encryption, and data sanitization for enhanced security.

- **Security Measures**: Implement security practices like rate limiting to protect the application from potential threats.


- **Email & File Handling**: Incorporate features for sending emails and uploading files, enhancing application usability.
